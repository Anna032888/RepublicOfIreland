<P><font size="4">From around 800 onwards Ireland was attacked by bands of Viking 
marauders. The raids continued right through the 9<SUP>th</SUP> century and a 
second major wave began early in the 10<SUP>th</SUP> century. The monasteries, 
as the major centers of population ad wealth, were the main targets of the 
Vikings.  They were despoiled of their books and valuables and many of them were 
burned.  These attacks, and attacks by the Irish themselves contributed to the 
decline of the great monastic tradition at this period.</font></P>
<P><font size="4">The Vikings wee great traders and did much to develop commerce in medieval 
Ireland.  They founded most of the major towns such as Dublin, Cork, Limerick 
and Waterford.</font></P>
<P><font size="4">The lack of any political unity made it difficult to resist the Viking 
attacks.  However, the strength of the U&igrave; N&egrave;ill kings in the northern half of 
the country prevented the Vikings from establishing themselves there.  Towards 
the end of the 10<SUP>th</SUP> century a new dynasty emerged in Munster in the 
south and, under the kingship of Brian Bor&ugrave;, was able to match the U&igrave; N&egrave;ill.  
Brian Bor&ugrave; defeated the Vikings in 999 and in 1002 he won recognition as king of 
all Ireland.  The Vikings intervened regularly in the disputes between the Irish 
kings. Their support for a Leinster revolt against Brian Bor&ugrave; led to their 
defeat at the Battle of Clontarf in 1014, after which they were confined to a 
subsidiary role in Irish political history.</font></P>
<P><font size="4">The 11<SUP>th</SUP> and 12<SUP>th</SUP> centuries were an age of renaissance 
and progress in Ireland.  Cultural activity and the arts prospered.  It was a 
great era of religious reform and a powerful effort was made to bring the church 
more fully into line with Roman orthodoxy. Two of the principal figures of this 
movement wee St. Malachy of Armaghand St. Laurence O’Toole of Dublin.  In 
politics, others sought to follow Brian Bor&ugrave;’s example and establish themselves 
as kings of all Ireland.  At various times between 1014 and 1169 the kings of 
Munster, Ulster, Connacht andLeinster succeeded in doing so.  The general trend 
was towards the development of a strong centralized monarchy on the European 
model.</font></P>
<P><font size="4">This trend was interrupted by the arrival of the Normans in 1167-1169. The 
first Normans came to Ireland from south Wales at the invitation of Diarmait Mac 
Murchada, king of Leinster, to support his ambition to become king of all 
Ireland.  The leader of the Normans, Richard de Clare, known as Strongbow, 
succeeded Mac Murchada as King of Leinster.  In 1171 the Normans' overlord, 
Henry II, King of England, came to Ireland and was recognized as overlord of the 
country by both Irish and Normans. Thus began the political involvement of 
England in Ireland that was to dominate the country’s history in succeeding 
centuries.</font></P>
<P><font size="4">The Normans quickly came to control three-quarters of the land. In time, they 
assimilated with the local population until they became, it was said, more Irish 
than the Irish themselves. The Normans had a major impact on the 
country. Throughout the 13<SUP>th</SUP> century they developed the same type of 
parliament, law and system of administration as in England.</font></P>
<P><font size="4">However, the native, or Gaelic, Irish exerted pressure on the Norman 
colony. Outside the colony attempts were made to reestablish the native 
kingship. Edward Bruce, brother of the Scottish king Robert, failed in his 
attempt in 1315, the last serious effort to overthrow Norman rule. By the end of 
the 15<SUP>th</SUP> century, due to the depredations of the Irish and the 
Gaelicisation of the leading Norman families, the area of English rule in 
Ireland had shrunk to a small enclave around Dublin known as the Pale.</font></P>
