<P>The earliest settlers arrived around 7,000 BC in the Mesolithic or middle 
stone-age period.  They arrived in the north across the narrow strait form 
Britain. These people were mainly hunters.</P>
<P>Colonists of the Neolithic, or new stone age, period reached Ireland 
around3,000 BC.  These were farmers who raised animals and cultivated the soil.  
Many remnants of their civilization — houses, potter, and implements — have been 
excavated at Lough Gur in Co. Limerick and some can be seen at the folk park now 
developed around the lakeside site. The Neolithic colonists were largely 
self-sufficient but engaged in a limited form of trading in products such as 
axe-heads. </P>
<P>Many of their religious monuments have survived, the most impressive of which 
is the great megalithic tomb at Newgrange in Co. Meath.</P>
<P>Prospectors and metalworkers arrived about 2,000 BC. Metal deposits were 
discovered and soon bronze and gold objects were being manufactured. Many 
artifacts made by these bronze-age people have been found, among them axe-heads, 
pottery and jewelry.  About1,200 BC another movement of people reached Ireland, 
producing an even greater variety of weapons and artifacts.  A common type of 
dwelling in use at this time was the crannog, an artificial island, with 
palisades on all sides, constructed in the middle of a lake.</P>
<P>The people who made the greatest impact on Ireland were the Celts. The 
earliest waves of Celtic invaders may have reached the country from central 
Europe as early as the 6<SUP>th</SUP> century BC with subsequent groups arriving 
up to the time of Christ.  The Celts belonged linguistically to the great 
Indo-European family. They soon came to dominate Ireland and the earlier 
settlers</P>
<P>The Celtic culture of the La T&egrave;ne civilization — named after a Celtic site in 
Switzerland — reached Ireland around the 2<SUP>nd</SUP> century BC.</P>
<P>Celtic Ireland was not unified politically, only by culture and language. The 
country was divided into about 150 miniature kingdoms, each called a tuath.  A 
minor king ruled a tuath, subject to a more powerful king who ruled a group of 
tuatha, who was in turn subject to one of the five provincial kings. This 
political situation was very fluid, with constant shifts in power among the most 
important contenders.</P>
<P>Celtic Ireland had a simple agrarian economy. No coins wee used and the unit 
of exchange was the cow. People lived on individual farms and there were no 
towns. Society was rigidly stratified into classes and was regulated by the 
Brehon Laws, an elaborate code of legislation based largely on the concepts of 
the tuath as the political unit and the fine, or extended family, as the social 
unit.</P>
