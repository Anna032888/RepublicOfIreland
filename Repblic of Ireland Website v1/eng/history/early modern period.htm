<P>In the 16<SUP>th</SUP> century the Tudor monarchs began a re-conquest of 
Ireland.  Henry VIII declared himself king of Ireland in 1541, the first English 
monarch to do so. The Tudors introduced new English settlers and embarked on a 
series of military campaigns against the Gaelic Irish and the great Anglo-Norman 
lords who had fallen away in their allegiance to the crown. When the army of 
Elizabeth defeated the Irish at the battle of Kinsale in1601, it marked the 
beginning of a new order. The native political system was overthrown and for the 
first time the entire country was run by a strong English central 
Government.</P>
<P>From the 16<SUP>th</SUP> century onwards the English Government made 
strenuous efforts to impose Protestantism. The reformed religion did not really 
take root, however, partly due to its close association with the repressive 
policies of the English administration. The main exception was in Ulster where 
the Government promoted a successful colonization by new settlers, mostly 
Scottish Presbyterians.</P>
<P>Religion added complexity to the political situation. The new colonists were 
Protestant and formed a distinct group from the Old English, the remnants of the 
Anglo-Irish colony who were still Catholic and increasingly disaffected from the 
Government. To a large extent political power and office were now in the hands 
of the colonists, the New English.  When the Gaelic Irish of Ulster rebelled 
against the Government in 1641 they were soon joined by their Old English 
co-religionists. In 1642 a rebel assembly, the Confederation of Kilkenny, met, 
but divisions soon appeared as Ireland became enmeshed in the English civil war 
between King and Parliament.  Oliver Cromwell and his parliamentary army 
ruthlessly crushed the rebellion.</P>
<P>Further Protestant colonization took place under Cromwell. This time the 
large-scale confiscation of land and the banishment of its former owners to the 
poorer areas of the country ensured that property and political power passed to 
the new colonists. The accession of the Catholic King James II in 1685 changed 
the situation only temporarily.  His pro-Catholic stance was unpopular in 
England and Scotland and among the Ulster Scots.  When William of Orange 
challenged James II for the throne the entire country except Ulster backed 
James. The two kings contested their throne in Ireland and William emerged 
victorious after a series of battles, the most famous being William’s defeat of 
James at the Boyne in 1690.  William’s victory left the Irish Catholics 
politically helpless and made possible the Protestant ascendancy that followed.  
Many leading Catholics like Patrick Sarsfield (James Commander-in-chief) went 
abroad to serve in continental armies.</P>
