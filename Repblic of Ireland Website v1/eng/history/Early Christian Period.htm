<P><font size="4">Christianity was introduced in the 5<SUP>th</SUP> century. This is 
traditionally associated with St. Patrick although there were some Christians in 
the country before his arrival. The first written documents date from this 
period. Ad distinctive feature of the development of early Irish Christianity 
was the important role played by monasticism.  The great monasteries such as 
Glendalough, founded by St. Kevin, and Clonmacnoise, founded by St. Ciaran, were 
famous centers of culture and learning and the illuminated manuscripts that they 
produced were among the glories of Irish monasticism.</font></P>
<P><font size="4">It was through the monasteries that Irish influence on Britain and Europe was 
exerted from the 6<SUP>th</SUP> century onwards. Setting out first as pilgrims, 
Irish monks preached the Gospel and established new communities across the 
continent. Ireland, unlike most of the rest of Europe, did not suffer barbarian 
invasion and so acted as a repository of Christian civilization at a time when 
it was almost extinguished elsewhere.  Irish monks are associated with a number 
of continental centers — St. Fursey at Peronne in France, St. Kilian at Wurzburg 
in Germany, St. Vergil at Salzburg inAustria, St. Columbanus at Bobbio in 
Italy. They brought Christianity to pagan peoples, established centers of 
learning and paved the way for the intellectual flowering in 
9<SUP>th</SUP>century France known as the Carolingian Renaissance. One of the 
most notable of these monks was the philosopher and theologian Johannes Scotus 
Eriugena.  </font></P>
<P><font size="4">The successful missionary efforts of the Irish abroad were matched by rich 
cultural achievements at home.  Elaborate chalices, crosiers and ornamental 
jewelry were fashioned while the scribes committed the rich classical tradition 
to their magnificently illuminated manuscripts.  This period from the 
6<SUP>th</SUP>to the 9<SUP>th</SUP> century has been seen by many as the Golden 
Age of Irish history.</font></P>
