<P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Secondary education 
in Ireland aims to build on the foundation of primary education to provide a 
comprehensive, high quality learning environment to enable all students to live 
full lives and to realise their potential as individuals and 
citizens.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>The secondary-level 
education sector comprises<B> secondary, vocational, 
community and comprehensive schools</B>. The majority of these schools are 
state-funded, and with the exception of a relatively small number, do not charge 
tuition fees. The types of schools mainly differ on the basis of administration 
and sources of funding:</FONT></P>
<UL>
<LI><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Secondary schools, 
which account for the greatest percentage of second level schools are state 
funded but generally privately owned and managed. Many are managed by religious 
orders or churches, others by Board of Governors, or by individuals.<BR>Over 
fifty Irish secondary schools provide <B>boarding 
facilities</B> and many of these have a strong tradition of enrolling 
students from abroad. In addition, a number of English language schools and 
private agencies assist overseas students at second level with application 
formalities and with finding home-stay or other accommodation. A full list of 
<B>boarding schools</B> can be found below and 
prospective applicants should contact their school of choice 
directly.<BR></FONT>
<LI><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Vocational schools 
are administered by the Vocational Educational Committees (VECs) of local 
government. The State provides 93% of the budget and the balance is generated by 
the VECs themselves. In addition to providing second level education, the 
vocational education system has become increasingly involved in devising and 
implementing a range of continuing education and training services to post 
second-level students.</FONT> 
<LI><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Community and 
Comprehensive schools are managed by Board of Management and receive individual 
budgets from the State. These schools combine academic and technical education 
as well as having a community dimension in terms of facilitating adult education 
programmes and facilities for community use.</FONT> </LI></UL>
<P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Second level 
education in Ireland generally starts at the age of twelve and consists of a 
three year Junior cycle followed by a two or three year senior cycle. The Junior 
Certificate Examination is taken at the end of junior cycle. The senior cycle 
has been significantly restructured in recent years and now offers a "Transition 
Year" which provides an opportunity for students to experience a wide range of 
educational inputs, life skills and work experience at a remove from the 
examination focus.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Students must take 
a minimum of five subjects including the three core subjects of English, Irish 
and Mathematics. Students can then choose their other subjects from a broad 
range including arts, languages, science and other applied subjects (e.g. 
mechanical drawing, woodwork etc.). Students entering the Irish education system 
after 11 years of age are not obliged to take Irish language 
examinations.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>At the end of the 
senior cycle the Leaving Certificate Examination is taken. Students normally sit 
for this examination at seventeen or eighteen years of age.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Students may choose 
one of three Leaving Certificate Programmes:</FONT> </P>

students must take at least five subjects, including Irish (with the exception

established programme detailed above, however there is an added vocational 
content and a concentration on technical subjects. Pupils taking the LCVP take 
five Leaving Certificate subjects (including two vocational subjects); a modern 
European Language and three link modules on Enterprise Education, Preparation 
for Work and Work Experience.</FONT></FONT></P>
