The earliest settlers arrived around 7,000 BC in the Mesolithic or middle 
stone-age period.  They arrived in the north across the narrow strait form 
Britain. These people were mainly hunters...<br><br><br><br><br>

Christianity was introduced in the 5<SUP>th</SUP> century. This is 
traditionally associated with St. Patrick although there were some Christians in 
the country before his arrival. The first written documents date from this 
period. Ad distinctive feature of the development of early Irish Christianity 
was the important role played by monasticism.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

From around 800 onwards Ireland was attacked by bands of Viking 
marauders. The raids continued right through the 9<SUP>th</SUP> century and a 
second major wave began early in the 10<SUP>th</SUP> century. The monasteries, 
as the major centers of population ad wealth, were the main targets of the 
Vikings. <br><br><br><br><br><br>

In the 16<SUP>th</SUP> century the Tudor monarchs began a re-conquest of 
Ireland.  Henry VIII declared himself king of Ireland in 1541, the first English 
monarch to do so. The Tudors introduced new English settlers and embarked on a 
series of military campaigns against the Gaelic Irish and the great Anglo-Norman 
lords who had fallen away in their allegiance to the crown.<br><br><br><br><br><br>

Throughout the 18<SUP>th</SUP> century Catholics were seen as a threat that 
might rally in support of a Stuart attempt to regain the English throne. The 
government enforced a severe code of penal legislation against them.  The 
Presbyterians also suffered religious disabilities but on a much lesser scale.  
Power was concentrated in the hands of the small Protestant ascendancy.<br><br><br><br><br><br>

From 1801 onwards Ireland had no Parliament of its own; Irish MPs (drawn from 
the ascendancy) sat in the Westminster parliament in London where they were a 
small minority.  Westminster was unwilling to grant major concessions to 
Catholics, despite persistent agitation. In 1823 a Catholic barrister, Daniel 
O’Connell, established the Catholic Association to press for full liberty for 
Catholics and rapidly converted it into a political mass-movement.
