<P><font size="4">The national flag is a tricolor of green, white, and orange. The tricolor is 
rectangular in shape, the width being twice the depth. The tree colors are of 
equal size, vertically disposed, and the green is displayed next to the staff.  
The flag was first introduced by Thomas Francis Meagher during the revolutionary 
year of 1848 as an emblem of the Young Ireland movement.</font></P>
<P><font size="4"> The green represents the older Gaelic and Anglo-Norman element in the 
population, while the orange represents the Protestant planter stock, supporters 
of William of Orange.  The meaning of the white was well expressed by Meagher 
when he introduced the flag. “The white in the center signifies a lasting truce 
between the' Orange’ and the ‘Green’ and I trust that beneath its folds the 
hands of the Irish Protestant and the Irish Catholic may be clasped in heroic 
brotherhood.”</font></P>
<P><font size="4"> It was not until the Rising of 1916, when it was raised above the General 
Post Office in Dublin, that the tricolor came to be regarded as the national 
flag.  It rapidly gained precedence over any flag that had existed before, and 
its use as a national flag is also stated in the constitution.</font></P>
