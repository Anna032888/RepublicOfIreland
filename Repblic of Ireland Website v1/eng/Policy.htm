<DIV align=justify>Ireland is a parliamentary democracy. The national parliament 
(in the Irish language, Oireachtas) consists of the President (an tUachtar&aacute;n) 
and two Houses: a House of Representatives (D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann) and a Senate (Seanad 
&Eacute;ireann). The Committees of the State are exercised by, or on the authority of, 
the Government. 
<P>The Constitution provides that the Government shall consist of not less than 
seven and not more than fifteen members. The Taoiseach (Prime Minister), 
T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance must be members of the D&aacute;il. The other members 
of the Government may be members of the D&aacute;il or Seanad, but not more than two 
may be members of the Seanad. The Government acts collectively and is 
responsible to the D&aacute;il. 
<P>The Taoiseach is appointed by the President on the nomination of the D&aacute;il. He 
must resign if he ceases to retain the support of a majority in the D&aacute;il. The 
Taoiseach nominates one member of the Government to be T&aacute;naiste. 
<P>The T&aacute;naiste acts in place of the Taoiseach if the Taoiseach is temporarily 
absent or becomes incapacitated.
<P>The Attorney General, while not a member of the Government, acts as legal 
advisor to the Government and may attend Cabinet meetings. The Attorney 
General's tenure of office is normally coterminous with that of the Government. 
<P>The Taoiseach assigns Departments of State to members of the Government. 
Usually, each member of the Government heads one Department of State, but 
occasionally a Minister is responsible for more than one Department. 
<P>Ministers of State, who are not members of the Government, assist Government 
Ministers in their Parliamentary and Departmental work. The maximum number of 
Ministers of State is fixed by law at seventeen. </P></DIV>
