Irish is a Celtic language and, as such is a member of the Indo-European 
family of languages.  Within the Celtic group, it belongs to the Goidelic branch 
of insular Celtic. Irish has evolved from a form of Celtic, which was introduced 
into Ireland at some period during the great Celtic migrations of antiquity 
between the end of the second millennium and the fourth century BC.

he earliest known form of Irish is preserved in Ogham (Old Irish 
spellingogam) inscriptions that date mainly from the fourth and fifth centuries 
or ourera.  The linguistic information preserved in Ogham is sparse, as the 
inscriptions contain little more than personal names, but it is sufficient to 
reveal a form of Goidelic much older than Old Irish, the earliest 
well-documented variety of the language.
