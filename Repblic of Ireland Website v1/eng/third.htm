Level Institutions</FONT></H1></center>
<P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>The third level 
education system in Ireland is broad in scope and encompasses the<B> university sector</B>,
 the<B> technological sector</B>, the <B>colleges of education</B> and <B>private, independent colleges</B>.The 
institutions which fall within the first three groupings are autonomous and self 
governing, but substantially state funded.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>The number 
participating in higher education in Ireland has increased significantly in 
recent decades with over 55 percent of students who complete second level now 
going on to higher education - one of the highest participation rates in the 
world. Entry to third level education for Irish students is competitive and 
based upon performance in the final<FONT color=#000000> secondary school</FONT> 
examination, <B>the Leaving 
Certificate.</B> Entry requirements for oversea students are determined 
individually by each institution and are generally based on national examination 
performance and English language aptitude.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>A number of 
institutions are authorised to confer their own awards.These institutions 
include the Universities, the Dublin Institute of Technology and a growing 
number of the Institutes of Technology. The <B>Higher Education and Training Awards Council</B> (HETAC) 
is authorised to make awards in the non-university sector. HETAC makes awards 
and sets and monitors standards at all levels of higher education and training 
up to doctorate level. Therefore, a number of institutes of technology and 
private, independent colleges provide programmes whose awards are made by 
Hetac.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>All recognised 
Irish awards will be included in the<B> National Framework of Qualifications</B> (NFE). The 
Framework was recently established to assist the national objective of moving 
towards a "lifelong learning society" by ensuring the existence of a single 
coherent, easily understood award system for all levels of education and 
training available in Ireland Today. The Framework is maintained by the<B> 
National Qualifications Authority of 
Ireland</B>(NQAI). The quality and standard of all Irish educational awards 
made by authorised institutions and HETAC are fully recognised 
globally.</FONT></P>
