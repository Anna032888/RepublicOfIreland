<font="000000">Nestled between the mountains and the 
sea, Ireland's capital city is vibrant and ever-changing and home to roughly a 
third of the country's population.<BR><BR>Medieval, Georgian and modern 
architecture provide a backdrop to this friendly, bustling port which can boast 
literary giants such as Joyce, Beckett, and Wilde as native sons. <BR><BR>Dublin 
is home to much of Ireland's cultural heritage. Magnificent public buildings 
such as Trinity College, Leinster House, and the Bank of Ireland at College 
Green are not to be missed. The country's most richly decorated manuscript, "The 
Book of Kells" is on view in Trinity College. The Book contains the four gospels 
in Latin and is breathtakingly beautiful. The National Museum in Kildare Street 
has superb displays of Irish Bronze Age Gold and early Christian treasures. 
<BR><BR>Other sights that should be on every visitor's list are Dublin Castle, 
Christ Church cathedral, the historic General Post Office where the 1916 Rising 
took place, and Kilmainham Gaol. A walk around Merrion Square and Fitzwilliam 
Square allows you to take in the splendour of some of the city's finest Georgian 
architecture. <BR><BR>Save some energy for later on, however, because Dublin 
comes alive at night. The city has one of the best pub and club scenes in 
Europe. Pubs range from trendy modern cafe bars to older distinguished pubs with 
sumptuous Edwardian or Victorian interiors. Night time entertainment is a rich 
mix of international dining, word class theatre, rock concerts, jazz clubs and 
traditional music. <BR><BR>The city also has the advantage of having 
surprisingly rural and picturesque suburbs. Coastal towns like Howth and 
Killiney allow the visitor to get away from it all without venturing far from 
the city.<BR></FONT>
