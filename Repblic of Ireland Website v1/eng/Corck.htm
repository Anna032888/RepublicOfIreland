<P>Ireland's second largest city, Cork is a county borough in Ireland and the 
capital of County Cork. It is located at the mouth of the Lee River at the head 
of Cork harbour.The word Corcaigh actually means marshland and the city was 
built in a marshy valley area where the Lee splits to form an island that is the 
heart of the city. </P>
<P>Tradition holds that the city was founded in the late 6th or early 7th 
century by St. Finbarr, who went there to kill the last dragon in Ireland and 
who built a monastery on the current south side of the city. Cork was taken by 
Henry II in 1172 and by Oliver Cromwell in 1649. The city is often called "Rebel 
Cork" because it was a centre of the 19th-century Fenian movement and played an 
active part in the Irish struggle for independence. In 1920 the centre of Cork 
was completely destroyed by the notorious Black and Tans during the War of 
Independence. The Mayor of Cork, Thomas MacCurtain, was killed by them in the 
same year. His successor, Terence MacSweeney, died in London's Brixton Prison 
after 75 days on hunger strike. </P>
<P>A famous landmark is the Shandon Steeple of St. Ann's Church, which contains 
the Bells of Shandon. Cork is the seat of University College (founded 1845; 
since 1908 part of the National University of Ireland). The Cork Film Festival 
is held each summer and it hosts a Jazz Festival each October Bank Holiday 
weekend . The famous Blarney Castle is just five miles north of the city. </P>
<P>Cork is a sporting town. In 1990, Cork was the first team of the twentieth 
century to capture an All-Ireland Championship in both Hurling and Gaelic 
Football in the same year. Cork also achieved this in 1890 and Tipperary 
followed in 1895. This is the city that named a bridge after a hurler (Christy 
Ring Bridge). The city is full of clubs that are great rivals, Nemo, The Barrs, 
The Glen, Na Piarsaigh to name a few. If you are in Cork during ' The 
Championship ' and any of these teams are involved, be sure and attend a match. 
The thrills and excitement should not be missed. Soccer fans support the local 
club Cork City.</P>
<P>There are a number of places worth visiting while in Cork. Start with the 
imposing St. Finbarr's Cathedral which was built by the renowned Victorian 
architect William Burges. Across the river is St Anne's Church, Shandon. This 
church houses the Shandon Bells and the tower has two sides faced with limestone 
and two faced with sandstone. Cork City Goal has a fascinating 35-minute taped 
tour and also houses the National Radio Museum where you learn about Marconi's 
conquest of the airwaves.</P>
<P>If you are interested in exploring the shops of Cork, you will also get a 
sense of the traditions of the city. Patrick Street and Grand Parade make up the 
commercial heart of Cork. Modern chain stores stand alongside the more modest 
businesses which have lined these streets for decades. Be warned though that 
parking is increasingly difficult to find in the centre of the city, especially 
on Saturdays and so you may be advised to make use of the efficient public 
transport system. One hundred yards from Patrick Street you will find the Coal 
Quay Market. This is an ideal place where you will be able to peruse local 
crafts and organic produce. If you are curious about the history of trade in the 
city, a visit to the Cork Public Museum in Fitzgerald Park is a must. Charting 
the history of Republicanism primarily, the museum has side exhibits on trade 
and the guilds in Cork as well as information on silver and glassware in the 
area. </P>
<P>Cork's cultural rivalry with Dublin extends to stout. Murphys and Beamish are 
two local stouts that are brewed here. Murphys is not as bitter as Guinness and 
Beamish has stronger 'roast' flavour. </P>
<P>Cork City is full of pubs and traditional music can be heard in a number of 
them. While in the centre of Cork, you should maybe try An Spailpín Fánach in 
South Main Street or An Bodhrán in Oliver Plunkett Street. The Long Valley in 
Winthrop Street is viewed as simply "a Cork institution". Cork is also well 
supplied with fine restaurants and interesting cafes and bistros.</P></FONT>
