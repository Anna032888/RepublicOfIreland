<center><h1><b>Parke Castle, Co. Leitrim</center></h1></b>
<P>Parke Castle on Loch Gill, formerly Sir Brian O'Rourke's Newtown Castle (16th 
century), was granted to Robert Parke, an English soldier and settler.
<P>Captain Robert Parke built this late-medieval fortified manor house in 1609. 
Romantics should take note, this castle is situated on the shores of Lough Gill, 
immortalized in Irish poetry by W. B. Yeats. 
<P>Parke's Castle highlights include an Irish oak interior, mullioned windows, 
parapets, and a courtyard that predates the castle by a century. The grounds 
also feature a cluster of old stone buildings and a wishing well. 
<P>The castle was beautifully restored about ten years ago and is one of 
Ireland's finest examples of Plantation architecture. 
<P>This castle is open to the public from April through October and tour 
includes an audio-visual on the story of the building and colorful exhibits.
