<IMG height=126 alt="Blarney Castle, Co. Cork" hspace=10

pictured in 1790 and now, is one of the most famous castles in the world. 
<P>On the parapet of a ruined tower lies one of the world's most revered pieces 
of stone. The Blarney Stone is believed to be half of The Stone of Scone upon 
which the Kings of Scotland were crowned. It was given to Cormac MacCarthy by 
Robert the Bruce in 1314. To kiss the Blarney Stone you have to lean backwards 
out of the parapet. 
<P>The castle was substantially destroyed by fire in 1820. Only the partial keep 
now remains. </P>
