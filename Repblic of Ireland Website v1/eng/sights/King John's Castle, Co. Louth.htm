<center><h1><b>King John's Castle, Co Louth</center></h1></b>
<P>This early Norman fortress was named after King John who visited Carlingford in 
1210. The western portion of the castle predates this visit and was probably 
commissioned by Hugh de Lacy c. 1190.
<P>A massive curtain wall divides the earlier western courtyard from the eastern 
wing, which contained the living quarters. The eastern section was constructed 
in the mid 13th century and has alterations and additions dating from the 15th 
and 16th centuries. 
<P>The castle commanded an important defensive position on the Lough but by the 
16th century it was described as in a wretched condition and remained so until 
conservation work in the 1950s. <BR><BR></P>
