<P>Unlike the vast caverns you may have encountered, Aillwee cave is unique to the 
geology of the Burren and it enables you to explore a little of what lies under 
the exciting landscape.</P>

<P align=left>This stunning creation of nature was formed by the melt waters of 
a prehistoric ice age. The cave, carved out of limestone, cuts into the heart of 
the mountain.</P>
<P align=left>The story of Aillwee Cave began millions of years ago when streams 
sinking underground on Aillwee Mountain started dissolving channels through the 
lines of weakness in the limestone.<BR>  </P>

About one million years ago the 
ice age began and from then until fifteen 
thousand years ago Ireland's climate alternated between arctic coldness and 
warmer periods, freezing and melting, freezing and melting over the centuries. 
</P>
<P>This melting water roared and crashed its way through an underground channel 
greatly enlarging the passage and bringing with it large quantities of sand and 
silts which are still present in the inner cave today.</P>
<P>Aillwee is one of the most ancient caves in the Burren and perhaps in 
Ireland.</P>
