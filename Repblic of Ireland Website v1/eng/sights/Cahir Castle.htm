<center><h1><b>Cahir Castle, Co.Tipperary</center></h1></b>

Cahir Castle (mainly 13-15th century), now fully restored, was the largest of 
its period in Ireland. It has a massive keep, high enclosing walls, spacious 
courtyards and a hall, and is now an architectural interpretative centre. A 
guide service is available all year round, Building began in the early 13th 
century when the castle came into the hands of the Anglo Norman Butlers in 1375. 
The Butlers of Cahir sided with the Irish in the Elizabethan Wars, and in 1599 
Elizabeth's deputy, the Earl of Essex, took the castle after a short 3 day siege 
in which the walls were widely breached by - the English artillery. In 1647 the 
castle was surrendered to the Parliamentary commander, Lord lnchiquin, by the 
guardian of Lord Cahir. George Mathews. Mathews also surrendered the castle to 
Cromwell in 1650 without firing a shot. Two years later the long war ended 
officially with the signing of articles in Cahir Castle. <br><br>
