<IMG alt="Boyle Abbey" 
src="pic2/boyle.jpg" 
align=left width="188" height="130">An impressive and well preserved Cistercian Monastery which was 
founded in the 12th century under the patronage of the local ruling family, the 
MacDermotts. Though mutilated during the 17th and 18th centuries when it was 
used to accommodate a military garrison, Boyle Abbey nevertheless retains its 
ability to impress the visitor as one of the most formidable of the early 
Cistercian foundations in Ireland. A restored gatehouse of 16th/17th century 
houses an exhibition. Restricted access for people with 
disabilities.</FONT><BR><br><hr>
