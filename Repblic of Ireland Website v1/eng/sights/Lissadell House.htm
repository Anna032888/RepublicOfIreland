Few houses have such colourful 
associations as Lissadell - the large and austere Grecian Revival home of the 
Gore-Booth family, beautifully situated amidst woods and glades on the north 
shore of Sligo Bay and immortalised by William Butler Yeats in his poem 'In 
Memory of Eva Gore-Booth and Con Markiewicz'. As a young man Yeats spent many 
happy days here with Eva, whom he likened to a gaZelle, and Constance, the 
'acknowledged beauty of the county'. In later years he fondly remembered the 
lofty bright rooms of Lissadell with their 'great windows open to the south' and 
the 'great sitting room as high as a church and all things in good taste'. The 
old rooms and furnishing <IMG height=148 alt=Lissadell

of the many remarkable people who have lived here. 
<P>The Gore-Booths stem from an Elizabethan soldier settler, Sir Paul Gore, 
ancestor of the Earls of Arran. The Sligo branch first settled at nearby 
Ardtermon Castle (now restored) but in the eighteenth century moved tb a house 
near the shore at Lissadell. Unfortunately, the damp situation and the danger 
from high tides was always a problem, so in 1833 Sir Robert Gore-Booth, fourth 
Bart (1805-76), commissioned the experienced London architect Francis Goodwin 
(178 1835) to design the present house. The conservative tastes of both patron 
and architect resulted in the adoption of a chaste neo-classical design - the 
last time this style was used for a large country house in Ireland. The exterior 
walls of grey Ballysodare limestone incor porate very little ornament apart from 
corner pilasters and a strong horizontal frieze, while the treatment of the 
interior is similarly austere, though relieved by a wonderful sensation of 
bright light and space pervading the rooms. 
<P>A <I>porte coch&egrave;re</I> with big oak doors gives access to a broad flight of 
steps leading up to the front hall - a lofty two-storey room with square Doric 
columns below and Ionic columns above. Kilkenny marble is used for the floor and 
also for the magnificent double staircase, notable for its iron balusters 
decorated with winged birds. Beyond the hall in the core of the house lies an 
enormous apse-ended gallery sixty-five-feet long lit by skylights and a 
clerestory with tall Doric pilasters along one side and freestanding lonic 
columns along the other. It was once the music room and retains its original 
Gothic chamber organ pumped by bellows in the basement. There is also a 
walnut-topped grand piano, old masters on the walls and souvenirs collected by 
Sir Robert Gore-Booth on his many travels abroad. His son Sir Henry Gore 
(1843-1900) was also a great explorer, and in this room stands a model of his 
yacht <I>Kara</I> on which he rescued his friend Leight Smith from the Arctic 
ice. It is said that Sir Henry's wife Georgina built the artificial lake at 
Lissadell in the vain hope that he might stay at home and fish in it, but as the 
harpoons and whale bones in the billiard room testify, Sir Henry was interested 
in much larger game. </P>
