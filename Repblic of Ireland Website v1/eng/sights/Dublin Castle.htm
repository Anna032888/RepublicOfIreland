<center><h1><b>Dublin Castle, Co.Dublin</center></h1></b>
<P>Built by the Normans in the 13th century, Dublin Castle has only two of its 
original towers and a portion of the medieval wall still standing. The rest of 
this former seat of British viceroys reveals architectural remodelling from the 
1850s. Well worth visiting are the sumptuous State Apartments, which were 
recently restored. 
<P>Dublin Castle is the heart of historic Dublin. In fact the city gets its name 
from the Black Pool ? 'Dubh linn' which was on the site of the present Castle 
Garden. The Castle stands on the ridge on a strategic site at the junction of 
the River Liffey and its tributary the Poddle, where the original fortification 
may have been an early Gaelic Ring Fort.
<P>Later a Viking Fortress stood on this site ? a portion of which is on view to 
visitors at the 'Undercroft'. The largest visible fragment of the original 13th 
century Norman Castle is the Record Tower. Beside it is the early 19th century 
Gothic revival Chapel Royal which was restored in 1989 and features particularly 
fine plaster decoration and carved oak gallery fronts and fittings.
<P>The Great Courtyard, best known from James Malton's celebrated view of 1792, 
contains the principal buildings of the post medieval Castle which formerly 
housed the vice-regal administration. The modern Conference facilities can be 
viewed from the Gate of Fortitude. The south range houses the magnificent State 
Apartments which were built as the residential quarters of the Vicarage court. 
They are now the venue for Ireland's Presidencies of the European Community, 
Presidential Inaugurations and State Functions. Dublin Castle Tourist and 
Conference Facilities are under the management of the Office of Public Works. 
The State Apartments, Undercroft and Chapel Royal are open to visitors (on 
occasion the State Apartments only may be closed for State purposes). The Vaults 
Restaurant, Heritage Centre and Craft Shop are also open to visitors. </P>
