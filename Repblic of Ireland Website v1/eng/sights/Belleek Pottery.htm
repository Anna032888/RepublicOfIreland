align=right>On the banks of the River Erne, on the border between Fermanagh and 
Donegal, lies Belleek, home of Ireland's oldest pottery.</P>

<P>For more than 137 years this little village has been famous for its 
distinctive parian china. Today Belleek holds a special place in the hearts of 
china collectors the world over. </P>

<P>The area hosts a cosmopolitan tourist population every year and many return 
to the village year after year. </P>

<P>When you purchase a piece of Belleek china you become the owner of a truly 
original piece of Irish craftsmanship, made using materials and techniques 
handed down from generation to generation. No two pieces are ever the same. </P>

<P>There were three founders, William Armstrong, (technical founder) 
John<BR>Caldwell (provided the land required) Bloomfield and David 
McBirney<BR>(provided the capital required).</P>

<P>Belleek's reputation has been built on product excellence and only 
Belleek<BR>of the very highest quality is ever put on sale. Back in 1857 the 
pottery's<BR>founder John Caldwell Bloomfield declared that any piece with even 
the slightest flaw should be destroyed. This rule still applies today.</P>
