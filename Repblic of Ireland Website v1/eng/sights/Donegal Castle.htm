<center><h1><b>Donegal Castle, Co. Donegal </center></h1></b>
<P>Donegal Castle was the residence of the O'Donnell Family, who were originally 
loyal subjects of Queen Elizabeth I. 
<P>This changed when the last of the family "Red" Hugh O'Donnell, with his 
friend, Hugh O'Neill rebelled and fought a bloody nine years war, which they 
lost and were forced to finally accept the English laws, language, religion and 
customs. In return "Red" Hugh was allowed to keep the castle and lands. After a 
few years of English interference, he fled to Spain where he was poisoned. 
<P>It is rumoured that before he left, he burned the castle to prevent the 
English using it. King James granted the castle to an English subject, Sir Basil 
Brooke, who rebuilt it. 
<P>The castle still has the original tower built by the O'Donnell's, but look 
out for the fireplace which has Brooke's English coat of arms engraved on it, 
and the Jacobean front door.</P>
