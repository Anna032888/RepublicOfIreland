Monea Castle, Co. Fermanagh</h1></B></center>

width=361 align=right> Following the Flight of the Earls in 1607, the English 
crown seized Irish lands in Ulster and granted large parcels to English and 
Scottish "planters" on the condition that they build settlements and provide 
strongholds loyal to the King. Soon thereafter, plantation castles were built to 
govern and defend against a hostile native population. 
<P>While in ruins, Monea Castle, west of Enniskillen, is the most complete and 
best-preserved of all the Plantation castles of Ulster. Building commenced in 
1616 by the Rector of Devenish, the Reverend Malcolm Hamilton. Shortly 
afterwards, in 1619, it was described by Pynnar as "a strong castle of lime and 
stone being 54 feet long and 20 feet broad". The bawn, comprising "a wall 9 feet 
in height and 300 feet in circuit" was added shortly before Hamilton was 
promoted to become Archbishop of Cashel in 1623. 
<P>Like so many of Ulster's Plantation castles, the design of Monea reflects the 
Scottish origin of its builder. Three storeys high with tall attics, it has a 
rectangular plan with a pair of massive semi-cylindrical towers on the short 
west end. These towers are corbelled out at attic-floor level to carry 
diagonally placed square caphouses with crow-stepped gable roofs. 
<P>The castle's only entrance lay on the south side of the north tower and led 
to a spiral stair giving access to the principal rooms, which were on the first 
floor and were illuminated by large windows with seats in the embrasures. 
<P>The bedrooms were on the second floor. The vaulted ground floor , lit only by 
splayed musket-loops, contained the wine cellar and kitchen. Contrary to usual 
Scottish practice, the roof was thatched and not slated. 
<P>The walled bawn is much ruined. It was defended by round flankers at the 
north end, one of which was later adapted as a dovecote. The entrance lay in the 
north-west corner, while along the west side survive the footings of a later 
building, possibly a barn. 
<P>During the 1641 rebellion it was attacked by Rory Maguire, who "slew and 
murthered eight Protestants" here, but evidently failed to capture the castle. 
In 1688 it was occupied by Gustavus Hamilton, the Governor of Enniskillen, who 
died in 1691 having incurred enormous financial losses in the Williamite wars. 
His greatly impoverished wife and children continued to live at Monea, but had 
to sell the estate in 1704. 
<P>A few decades later the castle was gutted by fire and was subsequently 
abandoned. In the last century "a weird woman named Bell McCabe took her 
residence in a vault beneath one of the towers" until she was evicted by the 
keeper, who feared she "might be found dead on the wretched premises,' and that 
some inquiries might ensue, involving the trouble incident to a coroner's 
inquest". </P>
