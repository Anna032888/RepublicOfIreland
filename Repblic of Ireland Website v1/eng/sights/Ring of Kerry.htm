<P><FONT size=2>One the most famous and popular road circuits for tourists in 
the South West of Ireland, the Ring of Kerry, traverses the coastline of the 
Inveragh Peninsula, with a great many tourist sites along the way.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>Dramatic panoramas, majestic mountain shapes, ancient sites and 
twee towns are found along the winding route of the N70 through the southern tip 
of Kerry, known as the Ring of Kerry. The 179km route is much travelled 
especially by coach tours, but that doesn’t take away from the scenic beauty of 
the peninsula.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>Running anti-clockwise, as the coach tours do, the route starts 
with the characterful market town of Killorglin on the sloping banks by the 
River Laune with the mountainous MacGillycuddy’s Reeks in the near distance, 
Killorglin comes to life for the famed Puck Fair festival in August. The road 
skirts the gentle scenery of Caragh Lake, a haven for fishermen, before coming 
to the small tourist town of Glenbeigh. The road then passes into Cahersiveen, 
overlooking Valencia Island and the birthplace of one of Ireland’s most eminent 
figures Daniel O’Connell. From here the road passes through the resort town of 
Waterville, and the world famous Waterville Links Golf Course, before coming to 
the picture postcard scene overlooking the coast of Derrynane, ancestral home of 
Daniel O’Connell and well worth a stop. The road then passes by the Staigue Fort 
at Castlecove, an early stone fort dating from the 3rd or 4th Century. The road 
then passes to the colourful little town of Sneem set beside a fast flowing 
river and then on to Parknasilla, a place of charming scenery and genial climate 
where subtropical plants and vegetation flourishes. The Ring then takes you on 
to the noble Heritage Town of Kenmare.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>You could cover the Ring of Kerry in a day, but you would need 
two or even three days if you wanted to take in some of the more rural and less 
travelled areas such as Valencia Island and the Gael Tacht area around Portmagee 
and Ballinskelligs or the mountainous interior of the peninsula, that is known 
as Ireland’s Highlands. The roads here, particularly the Bealach Oisin Pass and 
Ballaghbeama Pass of the interior are fabulous coach free routes ideal for quiet 
drives or cycling tours.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>The towns of Killarney and Kenmare make excellent bases for 
touring the area and Waterville is ideal for those wanting to see the 
dramatically rugged Skellig Rocks or play a few rounds of Golf.</FONT></P>
