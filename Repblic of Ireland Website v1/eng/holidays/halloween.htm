<DIV align=justify>The earliest celebrations of Halloween were among the Celtic 
who lived in the areas which are now Ireland, Great Britain and Northern France. 
<BR><BR>The Celts were people who worshiped the beauty of nature. They worshiped 
the Sun God and believed that without him, they would not live. They also 
worshipped Samhain (pronounced sow-in) who was the lord of the dead and of the 
cold, dark winter season. They believed that on October 31 Samhain would call 
together all of the dead and these souls would take on the shape of an animal. 
They believed that all creatures wandered the Earth on that night. This was 
called the Vigil of Samhain. <BR><BR>The Celts celebrated their new year 
on November 1. This day marked the end of summer and the harvest and the 
beginning of the dark, cold winter, a time of year that was often associated 
with human death. As already mentioned the Celts believed that on the night 
before the new year, the boundary between the worlds of the living and the dead 
became blurred. On the night of October 31, they celebrated the festival of 
Samhain, when it was believed that the ghosts of the dead returned to earth. The 
Celtic people feared the evening of October 31 more than any other day of the 
year. <BR><BR>The day itself was a time for paying homage to the sun god Baal 
who had provided the people with ripened grain for use in the upcoming winter.

Come evening evil spirits were everywhere. Charms and spells were said to 
have more power on the eve of Samhain. The Druids, or Celtic priests, would 
build fires on the hilltops in belief that the large fires would help to 
strengthen the Sun God, and give him power enough to overcome the lord of 
darkness so that the sun season could continue. They believed that the fires 
were sacred, therefore they burned dried crops and sacrificed animals to help 
strengthen the Sun God. At midnight they stop worshipping the Sun God and start 
to worship Samhain because he will be the ruler for the next six 
months.<BR><BR>

This is the starting of the new year (1st November). They would 
perform ceremonies through the night to ask the spirits to tell the future of 
the upcoming year. For clans entirely dependent on the volatile natural world, 
these prophecies were an important source of comfort and direction during the 
long, dark winter. In the morning each household receives an ember from the 
fire, this ember is used to start fires in their own homes with the belief that 
it will ward off evil spirits in the new year.

In the 7th century the church celebrated All Saint's Day in May but by the 
9th century the date had been changed to November 1. The original festival for 
the pagen Lord of the Dead became a festival of Christain dead. Still, people 
went on expecting the arrival of ghosts on October 31. 
<P>Another name for All Saint's Day was All Hollow's which later became 
shortened to Hallowe'en.
<P>Today in Ireland children dress up in costume and tick or treat and 
Jack-O'Lanterns are seen lighting the way for the witches and ghosts. </P></DIV>
