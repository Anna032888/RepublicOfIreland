<DIV align=justify>Saint Patrick is the Patron Saint of Ireland and the one 
credited with bringing Christianity to Ireland. The celebration of his Day is 
the only national holiday in Ireland. It is celebrated by morning mass, then 
parades and partying with lots of music into the night. While American's 
traditionally cook corned beef and cabbage for St. Patrick's Day, in Ireland it 
is bacon and cabbage. In the end they both taste about the same! 
<P>True history and legend are intertwined when it comes to St. Patrick. It is 
known that he was born in Scotland and was kidnapped and sold in Ireland as a 
slave. He became fluent in the Irish language before making his escape to the 
continent. Eventually he was ordained as a deacon, then priest and finally as a 
bishop. Pope Celestine then sent him back to Ireland to preach the gospel. 
Evidently he was a great traveller, especially in Celtic countries, as 
innumerable places in Brittany, Cornwall, Wales, Scotland and Ireland are named 
after him. 
<P>
<CENTER>Here it is where actual history and legend become difficult to 
seperate.</CENTER>
<P>Patrick is most known the world over for having driven the snakes from 
Ireland. Different tales tell of his standing upon a hill, using a wooden staff 
to drive the serpents into the sea, banishing them forever from the shores of 
Ireland. One legend says that one old serpent resisted, but the saint overcame 
it by cunning. He is said to have made a box and invited the reptile to enter. 
The snake insisted the box was too small and the discussion became very heated. 
Finally the snake entered the box to prove he was right, whereupon St. Patrick 
slammed the lid and cast the box into the sea. While it is true there are no 
snakes in Ireland, chances are that there never have been since the time the 
island was seperated from the rest of the continent at the end of the ice age. 
As in many old pagan religions serpent symbols were common, and possibly even 
worshipped. Driving the snakes from Ireland was probably symbolic of putting an 
end to that pagan practice. 
<P>While not the first to bring Christianity to Ireland, it was Patrick who 
encountered the Druids at Tara and abolished their pagan rites. He converted the 
warrior chiefs and princes, baptizing them and thousands of their subjects in 
the Holy Wells which still bear that name. 
<P>According to tradition St. Patrick died on 17 March in A.D. 493 and was 
buried in the same grave as St. Bridget and St. Columba, at Downpatrick, County 
Down. The jawbone of St.Patrick was preserved in a silver shrine and was often 
requested in times of childbirth, epileptic fits and as a preservative against 
the evil eye. Another legend says St. Patrick ended his days at Glastonbury and 
was buried there. The Chapel of St. Patrick still exists as part of Galstonbury 
Abbey. There is evidence of an Irish pilgrimage to his tomb during the reign of 
the Saxon King Ine in A.D. 688, when a group of pilgrims headed by St.Indractus 
were murdered. 
<P>The great anxiety displayed in the middle ages to possess the bodies, or at 
least the relics of saints, accounts for the many discrepant traditions as to 
the burial places of St. Patrick and others. </P></DIV>
