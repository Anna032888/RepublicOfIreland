<P>The earliest known form of Irish is preserved in Ogham (Old Irish 
spellingogam) inscriptions that date mainly from the fourth and fifth centuries 
or ourera.  The linguistic information preserved in Ogham is sparse, as the 
inscriptions contain little more than personal names, but it is sufficient to 
reveal a form of Goidelic much older than Old Irish, the earliest 
well-documented variety of the language.</P>
<P>Old Irish was the language of Ireland’s ‘Golden Age’, and its classical phase 
is generally assigned to the period AD 700-850. Old Irish evolved into Middle 
Irish, the language of the late Viking and post-Viking period.  In comparison 
with Old Irish, Middle Irish is characterized by a simplification of the 
inflections of noun and verb and of the system of pronouns.</P>
<P>By 1200 Early Modern Irish, or Classical Modern Irish, had begun to 
emerge. This is the language of the period of Gaelic resurgence when Old Irish, 
Norse, Norman, and Old English were largely assimilated into a new 
Irish-speaking society.  This form of Irish lasted from the thirteenth century 
to the seventeenth as the literary norm for the whole Gaelic world, which 
comprised Ireland, Gaelic Scotland, and the Isle of Man.  During the seventeenth 
century, as the influence of the old literary schools and learned classes 
receded, the forms of the written language became increasingly regional in 
character.  In this period the autonomous forms of Modern Irish, Scots Gaelic, 
and Manx became established. Even so, at the end of the nineteenth century and 
the beginning of the twentieth, as the Irish revival gathered momentum, there 
were many who felt that Classical Modern Irish was still the most appropriate 
norm for literary purposes.  Since the advocates of this view not only used the 
older grammatical forms, but also imitated the ornate and sometimes ponderous 
style of Early Modern prose, they brought reactions from writers such as Peadar 
&Oacute; Conaire, and Patrick Pearse, who were developing a literary diction based on 
contemporary speech.</P>
<P>The ‘Speech of the People’ movement triumphed, but one, perhaps unforeseen, 
result was that the written language for a time became quite diversified, as 
writers went their divergent ways in representing contemporary usage.  It was 
necessary to redefine norms.  A new spelling norm was published in 1945 and, in 
emended form, in 1947; a new grammatical norm was published in 1953 and, in 
revised form, in 1958.  These are now codified in &Oacute; D&oacute;naill’s official 
Irish-English dictionary, Focl&oacute;ir Gaeilge-B&egrave;arla, which appeared in 1978.</P>
