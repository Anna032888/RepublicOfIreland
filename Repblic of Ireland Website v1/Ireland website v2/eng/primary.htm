Education</FONT></H1></center>
<P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Although children 
are not obliged to attend school until the age of six, 65% of four year olds and 
most five year olds are enrolled in the infant classes in primary schools in 
Ireland. Primary schools operate an eight-year programme, consisting of two 
kindergarten years (Junior and Senior Infants), followed by classes 
1-6.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>The primary 
education system emphasises a child-centred approach and is founded on the 
belief that high quality education enables children to realise their potential 
as individuals and to live their lives to the fullest capacity appropriate to 
their particular stages of development. The primary curriculum (recently 
completely revised) provides for an extensive learning experience and promotes a 
rich variety of approaches to teaching and learning. The curriculum is divided 
into the following key areas:</FONT></P>
<UL>
<LI><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Languages</FONT> 
<LI><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Mathematics</FONT> 

<LI><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Social, 
environmental and scientific education</FONT> 
<LI><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Arts education 
(including visual arts, music and drama)</FONT> 
<LI><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Physical 
education</FONT> 
<LI><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Social, personal 
and health education</FONT> </LI></UL>
<P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>There are no formal 
examinations at the end of the primary school cycle.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>The school year 
runs from September until the end of June with holidays at Easter and 
Christmas.</FONT></P>
<H4><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#660066><B>Types of 
schools:</B></FONT></H4>
<P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>The Irish primary 
education sector consists of <B><A href="main_prim_sch.html">state-funded 
primary schools</A></B>, special schools and private primary schools. State 
funded schools include religious schools, non-denominatinal schools, 
multi-denominational schools and Gaelscoileanna. </FONT></P>
<H4><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#660066><B>Choosing 
a school:</B></FONT></H4>
<P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Generally speaking 
you should be able to send your child to the school of your choice. However, 
when it comes to enrolling your child, you may find that there is little or no 
choice in the area in which you live. Each school operates an admissions policy, 
which they must make available on request. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>State-funded 
primary schools tend to give priority to children living in the immediate area, 
but problems can arise if their classes are already full and they have a waiting 
list. Multi-denominational schools, non-denominational schools and 
Gaelscoileanna each decide their own admissions policy.</FONT></P>
<H4><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#660066><B>How to 
apply:</B></FONT></H4>
<P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Apply directly to 
the school of your choice. Ask for their admissions policy and check whether you 
need to register your child's name on a waiting list. </FONT></P>
