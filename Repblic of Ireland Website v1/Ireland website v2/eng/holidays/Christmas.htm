<P>
<DIV align=justify>Traditionally the Christmas season begins on 8 December in 
Ireland and lasts until 6 January. Christmas is a wonderful time to be in 
Ireland. In Ireland there is still a deeper sense of the meaning of the season 
here. As you walk through the streets of cities like Cork you may hear choirs 
large and small singing on the sidewalks, 
<IMG height=84 alt="" 
src="pic/flower.gif" width=118 align="left"> street musicians with flutes, 
harps, violins or guitars playing the strains of familiar carols or favourite 
Christmas recordings wafting from the shops.While few private homes decorate 
outside beyond the festive wreath on the door, the towns, cities and shops go 
all out. The Christmas season doesn't really get into full swing in Ireland 
until December when streets are lined with lit decorations and live Christmas 
trees are often mounted like flag staffs from building fronts. Larger department 
stores and shops fill their windows with animated scenes and figures. </DIV>
 
<P>Gifts for friends and from family members to each other pile up under the 
Christmas tree in the days before Christmas and as everywhere a lot of 
squeezing, shaking and guessing goes on, but in the back of everyone's mind is 
what Santa will bring on Christmas morning. And there is no peeking or opening 
any gifts <I>until</I> Christmas morning! 
<P>Santa Claus is a very popular fellow in Ireland too. He and his helpers can 
be found arriving at many malls and department stores by helicopter or fire 
engine to take Christmas wish lists or for the very lucky children a trip to 
visit his workshop in Lapland (the North Pole) can be arranged! 
<P>In Ireland Santa works a little differently than in the states. Instead of 
leaving everything under the tree he leaves each child's gifts in their room, 
often in a pillow case at the end of the bed, though sometimes a large gift may 
be left unwrapped under the tree. Christmas stockings are a tradition with some 
families and are hung Christmas Eve for Santa to fill. He arrives quite late as 
Midnight Mass on Christmas eve is still a strong tradition for many families and 
the chimney is his main entrance into most homes. 
<P><IMG height=137 alt="" hspace=8 src="pic/balloons.bmp" width=100 
align=right vspace=10> As with holiday traditions everywhere, food plays a big 
part of celebration in Ireland and, just like else where, there is some 
variation from family to family. A fairly traditional menu for Christmas dinner 
includes either a Goose or Turkey with stuffing (usually a sage and onion type), 
ham, roasted and boiled potatoes (Irish meals often include potatoes prepared 
several ways), brussel sprouts, carrots, califlower, parsnips and any other 
family favourites, followed by Christmas cake or a Christmas pudding. A 
favourite treat throughout the Christmas season are small mincemeat pies (in the 
states because of the size they would probably be called tarts). Candy canes are 
not very popular in Ireland nor wide spread but tons of chocolates is a must for 
Christmas. 
<P>Ireland, like most countries, has a number of Christmas traditions that are 
all of its own. Many of these customs have their root in the time when the 
Gaelic culture and religion of the country were being supressed and it is 
perhaps because of that they have survived into modern times. </P>
