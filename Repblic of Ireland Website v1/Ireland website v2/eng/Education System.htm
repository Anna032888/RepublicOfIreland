a sustained investment in this area Ireland now has one of the highest 
educational participation rates in the world - 81% of Irish students complete 
second-level and approx 50% go on to higher education. This dynamic, educated 
population has made its mark at home and abroad with international companies 
looking to Ireland again and again when hiring graduates for top class 
positions.</FONT></P>

size=2>Responsibility for education lies within the</FONT><B><FONT 
face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2><A 
href="http://www.education.ie/" target=_blank> Department of Education and 
Science</A></FONT></B><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" 
size=2><FONT color=#000000>.It administers all aspects of education policy 
including curricula, syllabi and national examinations. Attendance at full time 
education is compulsory in Ireland from six to fifteen years of age and is free 
in the majority of schools, and at undergraduate third-level. Education is 
considered a fundamental right under our constitution.</FONT></FONT></P>



<P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000 size=2>The 
Irish Education System was traditionally divided into three basis levels:<B> <A 
href="primary.htm">Primary</A></B>(8 years),<A 
href="secondary.htm"> <B>Secondary</B></A> (5 or 6 
years) and <B><A href="third.htm">Third 
level </A></B>which offers a wide range of opportunities from post-secondary 
courses, to vocational and technical training, to full degree and the highest 
post-graduate levels. In recent years the focus has expanded to include 
pre-school education and adult and <B>further education</B> as the concept of lifelong learning 
becomes reflected in the education opportunities available within the Irish 
education system. </FONT></P>
