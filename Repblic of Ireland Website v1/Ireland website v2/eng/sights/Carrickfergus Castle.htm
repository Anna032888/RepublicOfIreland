<center><h1><b>Carrickfergus Castle, Co. Antrim</center></h1></b>

<P>One of the finest Norman castles in Ireland, Carrickfergus Castle is sited along 
the harbour front, controlling the seashore. The mighty stronghold of 
Carrickfergus, once the centre of Anglo-Norman power in Ulster, is a remarkably 
complete and well-preserved early medieval castle that has survived intact 
despite 750 years of continuous military occupation. 
<P>The core of the castle, the inner ward and keep, was built by John de Courcy, 
who conquered east Ulster in 1177 and ruled as a petty king until 1204, when he 
was ousted by another Norman adventurer, Hugh de Lacy. Initially de Courcy built 
the inner ward, a small bailey at the end of the promontory with a high 
polygonal curtain wall and east gate. It had a number of buildings, including 
the great hall, and must have been very cramped, especially after the keep was 
built in the north corner. 
<P>Probably built in the late 1180s, the keep is a massive four-storey tower, 
90-feet high, with a second-storey entrance. Its entry chamber, originally one 
large, poorly lit room with a double latrine and no fireplace, served as the 
public room. A shaft gave access to a well below and a mural stair led down to 
the vaulted storage cellar. De Courcy's curia probably used the third storey, 
another poorly lit room, with a fireplace and a single latrine. The fourth 
storey, a high, brightly lit room with windows in all four walls, a fireplace 
and single latrine, was the principal chamber and must have served as de 
Courcy's private quarters. 
<P>Following its capture by King John in 1210, the castle passed to the Crown, 
and constables were appointed to command the place. In 1217 the new constable, 
De Serlane, was assigned &pound;100 to build a new curtain wall so that the approach 
along the rock could be protected, as well as the eastern approaches over the 
sand exposed at low tide. The middle-ward curtain wall was later reduced to 
ground level in the eighteenth century, save along the seaward side, where it 
survives with a postern gate and the east tower, notable for a fine array of 
cross-bow loops at basement level. 
<P>After being restored to the Ulster Earldom in 1227, Hugh de Lacy returned to 
Carrickfergus, where he remained until his death in 1242. It was almost 
certainly de Lacy who enclosed the remainder of the promontory to form an outer 
ward, doubling the area of the castle. Its curtain wall follows the line of the 
rock below, with two polygonal towers on the west and an impressive gatehouse 
with twin flanking towers on the north. Both towers were originally circular in 
plan, like the contemporary gatehouse at Chepstow in Gwent, but during the 
sixteenth century were cut in half and lowered in height to accommodate 
artillery. 
<P>A chamber on the first floor of the east tower is believed to have been the 
castle's chapel because of its fine Romanesque-style double window surround, 
though the original chapel must have been in the inner ward. The ribbed vault 
over the entrance passage, the murder hole and the massive portcullis at either 
end of the gatehouse are later insertions, probably part of the remodelling that 
followed Edward Bruce's long and bitter siege of 1315-16. 
<P>After the collapse of the Earldom of Ulster in 1333, the castle remained the 
Crown's principal residential and administrative centre in the North. During the 
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries a number of improvements were made to 
accommodate artillery, notably externally splayed gunports and embrasures for 
cannon, though these improvements did not prevent the castle from being attacked 
and captured on many occasions during this time. When General Schomberg besieged 
and took the castle in 1690, its importance was already in decline. 
<P>The castle was seized again in 1689 for King William and later by the French 
in 1760. Since that it has acted as prison, armoury and air raid shelter and is 
now open to the public. </P>
