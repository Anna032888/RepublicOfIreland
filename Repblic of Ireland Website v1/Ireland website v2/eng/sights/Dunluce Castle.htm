castlecrowned crag on the famous north Antrim coast was shaped when the sea cut 
deep into the land, exploiting cracks on either side of the rock. Dunluce castle 
was originally occupied by the O'Donnells and was set to seige by the British in 
the 16th Century. They eventually signed an accord with the British in the name 
of peace. The dark hollow on the very right of the castle was where the kitchen 
used to be. one night during a storm, that part of the castle broke off and 
plumged into the sea, killing all the cooks and kitchenhands. <BR></P>
