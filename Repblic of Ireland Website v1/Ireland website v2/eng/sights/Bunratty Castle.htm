<center><h1><b>Bunratty Castle, Co. Clare</center></h1></b>

<P>The three murder holes located in the walls of what was once the strongest 
castle in Munster enabled defenders to pour boiling water on attackers below. 
<P>The Vikings first set up a trading post on the castle site in 950. The 
MacNamara Clan built the great keep at Bunratty in 1425 and it subsequently fell 
into the hands of the O'Briens, Princes of Thomond. 
<P>The Anglo Irish Studdart family acquired the castle in 1720. They lived in 
the castle until the 19th century when they abandoned it and built Bunratty 
House, which stands on a hill at the opposite end from the castle. 
<P>In 1954 Lord Gort purchased the castle and restored it to its present 
condition. It is now part of the renowned Bunratty Folk Park and is open to the 
public year round. Twice nightly (subject to demand) banquets are held with a 
four course meal, wine and music following the tradition of hospitality 
surrounded by splendour at Bunratty. </P>
