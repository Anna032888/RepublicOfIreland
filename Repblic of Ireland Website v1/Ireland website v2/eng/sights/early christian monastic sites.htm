<center><h1><B>Early Christian Monastic Sites, Co. Kerry  </B></h1></center>
<P>The Dingle Peninsula's isolated location on the edge of the known world was 
possibly the reason that such a concentration of Early Christian monastic sites 
were founded there. 
<P>Today there are over 30 monastic sites with a variety of remains such as 
oratories, cross slabs, holy wells, beehive huts, shrines, burials, sun dials, 
and enclosing features. Some have been excavated, such as Reasc, near 
Ballyferriter; others, like Oileain tSeanaigh off the coast of Castlegregory, 
remain practically untouched since they were deserted some time in the 12th 
century. 
<P>It was from such sites of education, from the 6th century on, that Irish 
monks travelled throughout Europe converting Christians to the monastic life. It 
is from this period that the finest art works were produced, such as the Book of 
Kells and the Ardagh Chalice, among others.
<P>The Celtic Church in Ireland during this period is not under the direct rule 
of Rome, and thus was to retain many of the early pre-Christian influences. Many 
ring forts still survive from this period and are associated with habitation for 
both animals and humans. Fine examples are to be seen at D&uacute;n Cl&aacute;r at Annascaul, 
Cathair Dearg&aacute;in near Ballydavid, and Ballyhea on the Feothanach road. <BR><BR></P>
