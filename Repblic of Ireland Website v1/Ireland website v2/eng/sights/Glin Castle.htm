<P><FONT size=2>One of the great heritage houses of Ireland, Glin Castle has 
been home to the Knights of Glin, the FitzGerald family for some 700 years, and 
forms a fabulous residence, rich in elegance and history.</FONT></P>

align=left>Situated on the banks of the Shannon, within stunning private 
grounds, Glin Castle was built in 1800, a homage to medieval grandeur and 
Georgian splendour. The history of the estate and that of the flamboyantly 
titled Knight’s of Glin stretch back to the 12th Century, when the Norman 
FitzGerald's came to Ireland with Strongbow from Wales to aid the Irish High 
King Dermot MacMurrough. The Fitzgerald’s were granted land on the banks of the 
Shannon and the title of the Knights of Glin. In about 1200 they built their 
first castle, the ruins of which can be seen the village of Glin.<IMG height=207

<P><FONT size=2>Today Glin Castle is in the hands of the 29th Knight of Glin, 
whose association with Christies of London is evidenced in the astounding array 
of antiques and objects d’art as well as ancestral portraits and heraldic crests 
throughout the castle. From the colonnaded entrance, with elaborate plaster 
ceilings, the exquisite reception rooms are adorned with oil paintings and works 
of decorative art, together with the Knight of Glin’s famous collection of 
antique Irish furniture built up over the centuries, retaining a sense of the 
history of Glin Castle.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>A distinctive flying staircase leads to the bedrooms, each of 
which are sumptuously appointed and individually designed with traditional 
chintz d&eacute;cor and fabulous antique furnishings. Lavish four-poster and half 
tester beds, Irish prints and splendid old-fashioned bathtubs add to Glin 
Castle’s sense of plush cosiness and unique charm.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>Dining at Glin Castle is a suitably ostentatious affair of 
candlelight, glinting off crystal and silver set within the dining room with 
fabulous ancestral portraits and period features. The menu draws on freshly 
caught fish and locally reared lamb and beef with vegetables and herbs grown 
organically, within the castle’s walled garden to produce Irish country house 
cooking at its best.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>These gardens form the perfect setting for intimate walks 
through a gracious environment of clipped yew trees and Edwardian walled gardens 
with interesting nooks and crannies.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>Glin Castle is in close proximity to the famous golf courses of 
Ballybunion, Adare and Lahinch as well as the bustling towns of Limerick and 
Killarney and is less than two hours drive from Shannon Airport.</FONT></P><!-- #EndEditable --><!-- #BeginEditable "Facilities" -->
