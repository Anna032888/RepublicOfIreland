<center><h1><b>Lismore Castle, Co.Waterford</center></h1></b>
<P>There has been a castle at Lismore ever since 1185 when Prince John built a 
"castellum" on the present site. When John became King of England he handed the 
Castle over to the Church and it was used as a Bishop's Palace until 1589. The 
earliest remaining part of the Castle is a round tower, which dates back to the 
13th Century.
<P>In 1589 the Castle was leased and later bought outright by Sir Walter 
Raleigh. In 1602, when Raleigh was imprisoned in the Tower of London for high 
treason, he sold Lismore along with 42,000 acres for &pound;1,500 to Richard Boyle, 
who later became the first Earl of Cork. Richard Boyle's youngest son, Robert 
Boyle, the philosopher and father of modern chemistry, was born at Lismore in 
1626.
<P>Much of the present Castle dates back to the time of the first Earl of Cork 
and his coat of arms may still be seen above the main entrance gate.
<P>Lismore was considerably involved in the Cromwellian wars and, in 1645, a 
force of Catholic confederacy commanded by Lord Castlehaven sacked the town and 
Castle. Some restoration was carried out by the second Earl of Cork (1612-1694) 
but from then until 1800 very little was done to the Castle by its owners.
<P>James II stayed at Lismore Castle after the Battle of the Boyne in 1690 and 
on his way from Dublin to Kinsale from whence he fled to France. 
<P>In 1753, the Castle and its lands passed to the fourth Duke of Devonshire 
following his marriage in 1748 to Lady Charlotte Boyle, the only surviving 
daughter and heiress of the fourth Earl of Cork (1695-1753). The sixth Duke 
(1790-1858), known as the bachelor Duke, undertook the most extensive 
restoration of the Castle. 
<P>He was a patron of Dickens, Thackeray and, most importantly, Joseph Paxton 
(1801-1868) who joined the Duke's establishment as under gardener in 1823 and 
became his friend and consultant in many spheres. Botanist, inventor, engineer, 
architect, town planner, and railway promoter, Joseph Paxton not only designed 
the Crystal Palace for the London exhibition of 1851, he also organised the army 
works and served in the Crimean war, and became a Liberal member of Parliament. 
Tsar Nicholas 1st of Russia knighted him in 1844 and he was later knighted by 
Queen Victoria in 1851. It was he who played a leading part between 1840 and 
1858 in creating Lismore Castle as it is today.
<P>Adele Astaire, Fred Astaire's sister, married Lord Charles Cavendish (the 
present Duke's uncle) and lived in the Castle between 1932 and 1944. When her 
husband died she returned to America but continued to visit Lismore for a month 
each summer, during which time Fred Astaire was a frequent visitor. So much so 
that on two occasions in the visitors book his sister wrote after his entry, 
"What, not again", and, "I thought he'd never leave".
<P>The present duke is Andrew Cavendish, 11th Duke of Devonshire (b. 1920). His 
elder brother was married to Kathleen Kennedy, sister of President John F. 
Kennedy, and was killed on active service in 1944. Kathleen Kennedy died in a 
plane crash four years later. </P>
