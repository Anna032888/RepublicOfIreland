Ballintober Castle was probably built around 1300. It became the chief seat of 
the O Conors of Connacht. It is a large keepless castle with large polygonal 
flanking towers at the corners and a twin-towered gatehouse in the east wall. 
The ruin of the gatehouse is very low. <BR><BR>The flanking tower in the SW corner is the largest. The tower in the NW corner 
seems to have been used as a dwelling at a later date. It has large windows with 
square hood moulds and some fireplaces. There are remains of a spiral stairway. 
The castle was surrounded by a water-filled ditch and some good traces of this 
remain, especially on the west side.<BR>
The castle was taken by another branch of the O Connors in 1315 and was besieged 
and burned several times in the succeeding centuries. The NW tower was partially 
rebuilt in1627. The castle was held by the O Conor Don until 1652 when it was 
taken by the Cromwellians. It was restored in1677 and lived in until the 19th 
century.<BR>
