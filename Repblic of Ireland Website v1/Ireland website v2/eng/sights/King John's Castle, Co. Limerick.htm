<P>King John's Castle remains a most impressive Anglo-Norman fortification, even 
after 780 years. This five-sided castle was erected in the early years of the 
13th century, probably between 1200 and 1216, as a royal fortress on the River 
Shannon, and as an administration and military center for the most westerly city 
of the Angevin empire, ruled , as the name implies, by the Plantagenets from 
Anjou of France. 
<P>It was uniquely built for its day, without a keep and with high curtain walls 
to withstand the awesome power of the new siege machines. Its massive gate 
towers and drum comer towers were state-of-the-art features for the beginning of 
the 13th century. 
<P>Its corner towers and double-towered gate-house reflect the architecture of 
castle building around the year 1200. And, as the archaeological excavations 
have shown, the castle was built on the site of an early fortification, 
incorporating some of the earthwork defenses into the castle plan.
<P>During the 17th century sieges the castle suffered badly. In 1651 it was 
surrendered with the city to Cromwell's army. Patches of brickwork show hasty 
repairs after the siege bombardments of the early 1690s. Many alterations and 
repairs were carried out in the succeeding centuries. The domestic buildings of 
the courtyard do not survive, except for remnants of a 13th century hall and the 
site of what could be the castle chapel. </P>
