<P><left><IMG height=141 alt="Irish Castles" hspace=8 src="pic2/griananofaileach.gif" 
width=210 align=left vspace=6></left>On the top of the Greenan mountain, not far from the border of Northern 
Ireland, lies Grianan of Aileach, one of the finest stone forts in Ireland. From 
the hill-top there are commanding views over Lough Foyle, Lough Swilly, and 
Londonderry, about 8km (5 mi) to the East.
<P>The massive stone wall is 3.9m (13ft) thick and encloses an area 23.4m (77ft) 
in diameter. In the walls are small chambers; a series of stairs at regular 
intervals inside the walls gave access to the wall-walk. The entrance is very 
long and lintelled.
<P>Legend says it was built by the ancient gods; the ring fort was known as the 
Sun Palace and was held sacred. Traces of ancient earthworks, dating to the 
early Iron Age, surround the fort, enclosing an area of about 5 acres (0.02 
km2). 
<P>The fort itself was probably built in the early centuries of the Christian 
era. From the 5th to the 12th century AD it served as the royal seat of the O 
Neill sept of Aileach; it was destroyed by Murtogh O Brien, king of Munster in 
1101. To make the demolition complete, the king ordered each of his soldiers to 
take away a stone from the fort. Grianan of Aileach was reconstructed by Dr 
Bernard of Derry in 1870, but archaeologists are doubtful about the inner 
restoration. <BR><BR>Surrounding the stone fort are three concentric low walls 
which formed part of the original fortification of the fort. </P>
