<P>Throughout the 18<SUP>th</SUP> century Catholics were seen as a threat that 
might rally in support of a Stuart attempt to regain the English throne. The 
government enforced a severe code of penal legislation against them.  The 
Presbyterians also suffered religious disabilities but on a much lesser scale.  
Power was concentrated in the hands of the small Protestant ascendancy.</P>
<P>The American War of Independence had an important influence on Irish 
politics.  The American example encouraged the Protestant ascendancy to press 
for a measure of colonial self-government.  In 1782, the Irish parliament, 
hitherto subservient to London, was granted independence. Ireland was now 
effectively a separate kingdom sharing a monarch with England, but the Dublin 
administration was still appointed by the King. One of the leading figures in 
this parliament was Henry Grattan.  From 1778 onwards the penal legislation 
against Catholics was gradually repealed.  The parliament made moves to improve 
and liberalize trade.</P>
<P>The French Revolution, with its ideas of equality and liberty , had a major 
impact on Ireland.  The Society of the United Irishmen was founded in 1791 to 
press for radical reform. Its members were mainly Presbyterians from the 
north. The leading figures were Wolfe Tone, Napper Tandy and Lord Edward 
Fitzgerald.  The war with France led to severe military repression in Ireland.  
The United Irishmen rebelled in 1798, aiming to unite Catholics and Protestants, 
including Presbyterians, and to break Ireland’s link with England. In spite of 
French help the rebellion was badly organized and easily suppressed.</P>
<P>After the defeat of the rebellion, the London Government decided to unite the 
British and Irish parliaments.  The Irish parliament, an unrepresentative 
assembly, was induced to vote itself out of existence in 1800.</P>
