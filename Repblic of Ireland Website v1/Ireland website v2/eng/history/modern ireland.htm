<P>From 1801 onwards Ireland had no Parliament of its own; Irish MPs (drawn from 
the ascendancy) sat in the Westminster parliament in London where they were a 
small minority.  Westminster was unwilling to grant major concessions to 
Catholics, despite persistent agitation. In 1823 a Catholic barrister, Daniel 
O’Connell, established the Catholic Association to press for full liberty for 
Catholics and rapidly converted it into a political mass-movement. O’Connell’s 
success forced the London parliament to grant Catholic Emancipation in 1829, 
removing virtually all the disabilities against Catholics.</P>
<P>O’Connell, the most popular figure in the country, now sought repeal of the 
Act of Union of 1800 and the restoration of the Irish parliament. He set up the 
Repeal Association and modeled his campaign on that for emancipation.  The 
agitation was characterized y mass meetings, some attracting hundreds of 
thousands of people. The London government resisted and when a Dublin rally was 
banned in1843, O’Connell acquiesced.  This marked the effective end of the 
repeal campaign.</P>
<P>In the 1840’s the Young Ireland movement was formed. The most influential of 
its leaders was Thomas Davis who, like the United Irishmen, expressed a concept 
of nationality embracing all who lived in Ireland, regardless of creed or 
origin.  An attempt by the Young Irish to stage an insurrection failed in 1848, 
but their ideas strongly influenced later generations.</P>
<P>The end of war in Europe in 1815 had a drastic impact on the economy. The war 
had led to a huge growth in tillage farming to supply the armies, and a 
dependence on the potato as a staple food. When war ended there was a change 
from tillage to pasture, causing agrarian unemployment.  Population increased 
rapidly and reached 8 million by 1841, two-thirds of whom depended on 
agriculture.  In this precarious agrarian economy the failure of the potato crop 
in 1845 due to blight, proved disastrous.  The crop failed again in 1846, 1847, 
and 1848 and coupled with sever weather, resulted in famine. By 1851 the 
population had been reduced by at least 2 million due to starvation, disease and 
emigration to Britain and the United States.</P>
<P>The latter half of the 19<SUP>th</SUP> century was characterized by campaigns 
for national independence and land reform. The Irish Republican Brotherhood 
(IRB), also known as the Fenians, was founded in 1858.  The Fenians, a secret 
society, rejected constitutional attempts to gain independence as futile. Among 
the leaders of the Fenians were James Stephens and John O’Leary. Staged an armed 
uprising in 1867.  The rising was no more than a token gesture and was put 
down. The IRB continued in existence, however.</P>
<P>A constitutional movement seeking Home Rule was set up by Isaac Butt. The 
Home Rulers, who sought a separate parliament subordinate to London, won half 
the Irish seats in the 1874 election. Leadership of the movement soon passed to 
Charles Stewart Parnell.</P>
<P>The strained relations between landlords and their tenant farmers were a 
constant social and political difficulty.  In1879 Michael Davitt founded the 
National Land League. The League aimed to secure basic rights for tenant farmers 
— fair rent, free sale and fixity of tenure.  Parnell became president of the 
movement.  Many Fenians also joined.  The result was a great national campaign 
of mass agitation from 1879 to 1882, which forced the British government to pass 
a series of Land Acts. These eventually abolished the old landlord system and 
transferred ownership of the land to the people who worked it.</P>
<P>Parnell then used the agrarian movement as the basis to agitate for Home Rule 
in the 1885 election.  The Home Rule party swept the countryside outside eastern 
Ulster. Gladstone, the British Prime Minister, responded by introducing a Bill 
in Parliament to grant Home Rule but this was defeated in 1886, as was another 
in1894.  The impetus of the Home Rule campaign was effectively lost with the 
death of Parnell in 1891.</P>
<P>However, the years after Parnell’s death saw the growing emergence of a 
cultural nationalism.  The Gaelic Athletic Association, founded in 1884, 
promoted the national games while the Gaelic League, founded in 1893 by Douglas 
Hyde and Eoin MacNeill, tried to revive the Irish language and culture on a 
nationwide basis. At the same time Arthur Griffith developed a new political 
party in the period 1905-1908 known as Sinn F&eacute;in — ‘We Ourselves’. The Sinn F&eacute;in 
policy was that Irish MPs should withdraw from Westminster and establish an 
independent parliament.  Sinn F&eacute;in had close links with the IRB.  The Dublin 
labor dispute of 1913 produced another group, the Irish Citizen Army, which was 
socialist but also separatist.</P>
<P>In 1912 another Home Rule bill was introduced in Westminster. This brought 
considerable success to the Irish Parliamentary Party, now led by John Redmond.  
However, resistance to the measure was strong in north-east Ulster. Sir Edward 
Carson who set up the Ulster Volunteers to oppose Home Ruled it.  In response, 
the Irish Volunteers, largely controlled by the IRB, were founded in Dublin.</P>
<P>The Home Rule bill was finally passed in 1914, but its implementation was 
shelved upon the outbreak of war.  John Redmond encouraged Irishmen to enlist in 
the British Army hoping this would sustain British support for Home Rule. Others 
disagreed with this policy and in 1916 the Irish Volunteers, led by Patrick 
Pearse and the Irish Citizen Army led by James Connolly, staged a rebellion 
against British rule.  The Easter Rising of 1916 was put down but the decision 
of the British to execute several of the leaders alienated public opinion. In 
the 1918 general election Sinn F&eacute;in totally defeated the Irish Parliamentary 
Party.</P>
<P>The Sinn F&eacute;in representatives now constituted themselves as the first D&aacute;il, 
or independent Parliament, in Dublin.  &Eacute;amon de Valera headed the D&aacute;il. The 
British attempt to smash Sinn F&eacute;in led to the War of Independence of1919-1921.  
Michael Collins led the Irish forces.  After more than two years of guerilla 
struggle a truce was agreed. In December 1921 an Anglo-Irish Treaty was signed 
and 26 counties gained independence as the Irish Free State.  Six Ulster 
counties had been granted their own parliament in Belfast in 1920 and remained 
within the United Kingdom.</P>
<P>The establishment of the Free State was followed by a civil war between the 
new government and those who opposed the Treaty. &Eacute;amon de Valera led those who 
opposed the treaty. A truce was negotiated in May 1923 but the Civil War claimed 
the lives of many who had been prominent in the struggle for independence among 
them Michael Collins and Cathal Brugha. </P>
