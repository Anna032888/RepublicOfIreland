<DIV align=justify>In 1841, shortly before the Great Famine, the area comprising 
the present Irish State had a population of over 6.5 million. The next census 
(1851) showed a massive decline to 5.1 million for the same area, due to deaths 
from starvation and disease and large-scale emigration. The outflow thus begun 
became a dominant feature of the population pattern over the succeeding years. 
<P>By 1961 the population of the State stood at 2.8 million, the lowest census 
figure on record. From 1961 onwards the pattern changed. A combination of 
natural increase and the commencement of inward net migration resulting from 
increased prosperity produced an average annual rise in population of 0.6% in 
the period 1981 to 1986. Between 1986 and 1991, largely as a result of the 
resumption of emigration, an average annual fall in population of 0.1% was 
recorded. 
<P>At the 1996 census, the population of the State was 3,626,087. About 60% of 
the people live in cities and towns of 1,000 or more inhabitants. Population 
densities are highest in the east and south. 
<P>The population is very young with approximately 41% under 25 years of age and 
24 per cent under fifteen. </P></DIV>
