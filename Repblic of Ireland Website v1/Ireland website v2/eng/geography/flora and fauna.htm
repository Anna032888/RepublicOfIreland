  <font size="4">
I<span style="font-weight: 400">reland was separated from the European mainland after the 
last Ice Age. As a result the island has a smaller range of flora and fauna than 
is found elsewhere in Europe.<BR><BR>In the Burren area, an Arctic-Alpine plants 
survive from the last glaciation. Ireland's bogs host a large variety of 
bog-moss species together with heather and sedges. In the south west (Cork and 
Kerry), there are areas rich in plants that thrive in the mildness and humidity 
of this region's climate. </span></font> 
<P><font size="4">The once extensive oak forests were cleared over most of the country by the 
seventeenth century. In recent decades a re-afforestation programme has favoured 
Sitka spruce, Scots, contorta and other pines, larches, Norway spruce and 
Douglas fir. There are nature reserves and national parks throughout the 
country. </font> 
<P><font size="4">Of some 380 species of wild birds recorded in Ireland, 135 breed in the 
country. There is considerable migration of birds to Ireland in spring and 
autumn, while several species arrive from Greenland and Iceland in winter; 75 
per cent of the world's population of the Greenland whitefronted goose winter in 
Ireland. </font> 
<P><font size="4">Inland waters support colonies of swans, geese, waders, duck, tern and gulls. 
Game shooting is strictly controlled and State-assisted restocking programmes 
augment stocks of wild game birds. Among the more unusual species of bird are 
merlin, peregrine falcons, corncrake and chough. </font> 
<P><font size="4">Amphibians are represented by a single native species each of frog, toad 
(natterjack) and newt. There are no snakes and there is only one native reptile, 
the common lizard. </font> 

<P><font size="4">Freshwater species of fish include salmon, char, pollan, eel, pike and brown 
trout.<BR><BR>Mammals are similar to those found throughout the temperate 
regions of Europe. There are 31 species of mammals including red deer, fox, 
badger, red squirrel, otter, grey seals, common seals and many cetacean species. 
The Irish stoat and the Irish hare are interesting examples of native 
development. </font> 
<P><font size="4">The National Parks and Wildlife Service is responsible for conservation in 
the Republic of Ireland. Most species of wild fauna and several species of wild 
flora are protected. </font> 
<right><img src="pic/cows.jpg" align="right" width="225" height="170"></right>
<P><font size="4">Conservation of wildlife habitats is achieved through the creation of nature 
reserves of which there are 75, together with 5 refuges for fauna and the 
designation of special protection areas for wild birds. </font> 
<P><font size="4">The National Parks and Wildlife Service is also responsible for the 
development and management of national parks and nature reserves. </font> 
<P><font size="4">To date, five national parks have been established. All five meet 
international standards for national parks, conserving as they do outstanding 
parts of the natural heritage. </font> 
<P><font size="4">They are located at Killarney, Co. Kerry; Glenveagh, Co. Donegal; Connemara, 
Co. Galway; The Burren, Co. Clare; and the Wicklow Mountains, Co. Wicklow.
</font> 
<P><font size="4">In recent years State forests have been opened to the public. There are 11 
large forest parks and over 400 smaller amenities. Public access is generally 
limited to pedestrians. </font> </P></DIV>
