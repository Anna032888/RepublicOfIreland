<body><center><h1><b>About Holidays</center></h1></b>
I get many requests for information about how various 
holidays and special occasions are celebrated in Ireland. <BR><BR>For the most 
part major holidays are celebrated much the same as in the United States. In 
doing research to find special traditions in Ireland I have been surprised to 
find many of the time honoured traditions that seem to be part of various 
celebrations around the world actually originated in Ireland!<BR><BR>One example 
I have recently discovered is the tradition of hanging a wreath on the door at 
Christmas. Many may remember when the traditional wreaths were made of holly. 
The tradition of hangin a circle of holly on the door at Christmas originated in 
Ireland.<BR><BR>Another that few people know is the after wedding ceremony 
custom of a honeymoon. Both the word and the custom also came from 
Ireland!<BR><BR>In the states there are holidays such as Memorial Day, Labor 
Day, Fourth of July, Thanksgiving, Vetern's Day, Presidents Day (well, you get 
the idea...) but in Ireland there aren't a plethora of holidays that people get 
time off for aside from Christmas, St. Stephen's Day, Good Friday, Easter and 
St. Patrick's Day. <BR><BR>Instead 6 Mondays throughout the year are designated 
'Bank Holidays'. On these days banks, shops, schools and almost everything else 
is closed. This gives people several three day weekends throughout the year for 
a holiday. <BR><BR>Many people take advantage of these weekends and take short 
trips or plan other activities and you will often find 'Bank Holiday Weekend' 
specials being run by hotels and B&amp;B's.<br><br>

Easter is named after the Anglo-Saxon goddess of spring (Eostre), and is 
originally a pagan (non-Christian) festival.

<br>

Saint Patrick is the Patron Saint of Ireland and the one credited with bringing 
Christianity to Ireland. The celebration of his Day is the only national holiday 
in Ireland.

Traditionally the Christmas season begins on 8 December in Ireland and lasts 
until 6 January. Christmas is a wonderful time to be in Ireland. In Ireland 
there is still a deeper sense of the meaning of the season here.

<a href="holidays/halloween.htm">Halloween
<br>
<left><img src="pic1/Halloween024.gif" align="left" width="99" height="100"></left></a>
The earliest celebrations of Halloween were among the Celtic who lived in the 
areas which are now Ireland, Great Britain and Northern France. <BR>
