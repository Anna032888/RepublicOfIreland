<P>The national flag is a tricolor of green, white, and orange. The 
tricolor is rectangular in shape, the width being twice the depth. The tree 
colors are of equal size, vertically disposed, and the green is displayed next 
to the staff.  The flag was first introduced by Thomas Francis Meagher during 
the revolutionary year of 1848 as an emblem of the Young Ireland 
movement.</P>

The harp has been regarded as the official symbol or coat of arms of Ireland 
since medieval times.&nbsp; As such it is depicted alongside the coats of arms 
of a dozen or more medieval European kingdoms on a single folio of the 
Wijnbergen roll of arms compiled about 1270.
