<P> <font size="4">The harp has been regarded as the official symbol or coat of arms of Ireland 
since medieval times.  As such it is depicted alongside the coats of arms of a 
dozen or more medieval European kingdoms on a single folio of the Wijnbergen 
roll of arms compiled about 1270.  The harp is found on the banners of the Irish 
brigades, which were formed in the armies of continental European countries 
during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.</font></P>

14<SUP>th</SUP>century harp now preserved in the Museum of Trinity College 
Dublin, popularly known as the Brian Bor&uacute; harp.</font></P>
