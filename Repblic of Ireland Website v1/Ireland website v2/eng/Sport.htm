<P class=indent>Ireland's mark on the world of sport has been disproportionate 
to the size of the country. Irish soccer teams have won European Championships 
at youth level and Irish players play for clubs all over Europe. Ireland has 
produced some of the best golfers, snooker players, cyclists, boxers and jockeys 
in the world and our athletes have triumphed at championship and Olympic level. 
</P>
<P class=indent>Gaelic Football and Hurling, as Ireland's native sports are the 
most popular. The major competitions in each sport are the All-Ireland 
Championships which are contested by teams from each of the 32 counties. The 
All-Ireland finals are played at Croke Park in Dublin, which is the headquarters 
of the GAA (Gaelic Athletic Association) in Ireland and is currently undergoing 
a major development programme. </P>
<P class=indent>Soccer is also very popular in Ireland and is governed by the 
Football Association of Ireland (FAI). However the senior domestic competition 
do not reflect the real strength of soccer as many talented players play in 
leagues abroad. Many of these same players, play for the national team which 
enjoys a large following. </P>

Rugby Football has about 60,000 Irish participants at club and 
school level and competition exists in the form of schoolboy, club and 
provincial leagues and championships. The Irish Rugby Football Union (IRFU) is 
the governing body for the sport and the Irish international team draws large 
crowds. </P>
<P class=indent>Athletics and particularly track and field athletics has a long 
tradition in Ireland, which has produced a long list of past World and Olympic 
Champions. The most popular events are running, over middle and long distances 
and on marathon, track and indoor cross-country courses. Current athletics stars 
include Catherina Mc Kiernan and Sonia O'Sullivan, both cross-country champions 
at European and World levels. </P>
<P class=indent>Equestrian: The Irish bloodstock industry is considered one of 
the finest in the world. Famous racehorses produced include Arkle, Dawn Run, 
Istabraq, Nijinsky and Saddlers Wells. Ireland has produced a string of leading 
riders in all disciplines including Michael Kinnane, Richard Dunwoody and Eddie 
Macken.</P>
<P class=indent>The sports of Snooker, golf, boxing and many other sports have 
seen Irish sportsmen and women compete and triumph at the highest level. </P>
